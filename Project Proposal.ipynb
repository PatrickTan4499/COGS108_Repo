    " \n",
    "    Understanding patterns of crime is crucial for police forces to maintain safety for the entire society. Numerous criminology studies have been conducted in the past to show that certain crimes are potentially conducted following temporal and spatial patterns, and thanks to development in methods of data collection and analysis, researchers and police are able to get sufficient data nowadays. We as a group are particularly interested in looking for a pattern between the frequency of specific types of crime and days within a weekly cycle. \n",
    " \n",
    "    We found an article from the Oklahoman news website that tried to answer a similar question, except that it used data collected by the Oklahoma City police department. The result suggests that cases of burglary most commonly take place on Mondays and are the least common on Sundays, while cases of assault with weapons are most common on Saturdays and least common on Thursdays. We want to take a similar approach by looking at data within the region of San Francisco to see if there is a similar pattern here.\n",
    " \n",
    "    Additionally, we found previously published work about car theft in San Francisco based on the time of day and day of the week. This research specifically focuses on car theft and focuses on the location and time of the crime, which is similar to the approach that we would want to take while doing our data science project.\n",
